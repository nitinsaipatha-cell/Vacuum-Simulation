# Smart Vacuum Cleaning Simulation System

This repository contains a real-time vacuum cleaning environment simulation system implemented using intelligent movement and cleaning logic. The system provides a graphical interface to simulate a vacuum agent navigating and cleaning a grid-based environment efficiently.

The application evaluates dirt placement, movement rules, environment size, and cleaning strategy to determine how the vacuum cleans the space.

## Project Overview

This project simulates how an automated vacuum cleaner can clean an environment using algorithmic decision-making.

- The environment grid is generated through the GUI.
- The system continuously evaluates dirty cells and directs the vacuum agent accordingly.
- Users can start, reset, or simulate multiple cleaning runs.
- The system visually demonstrates automated cleaning behavior.

## System Details

- **Core Logic:** Grid-based simulation with rule-based movement  
- **Framework:** Tkinter (GUI)  
- **Language:** Python  

## Cleaning Factors

- Grid size  
- Random dirt placement  
- Vacuum starting position  
- Movement direction logic  
- Cleaning detection system  
- Step-by-step simulation

```

## What the Program Does

- Generate a grid-based environment  
- Randomly place dirt in cells  
- Display the vacuum cleaner position  
- Automatically clean dirty cells  
- Move step-by-step through the environment  
- Show cleaning progress visually  
- Allow reset and rerun of simulation  

## Export Information

If export functionality is implemented, outputs may include:

- Simulation logs  
- Cleaning step reports  
- Grid status snapshots  

## Simulation Mode

The simulator can:

- Generate random dirty environments  
- Move the vacuum automatically  
- Demonstrate cleaning efficiency  
- Track total steps taken  
- Reset and rerun multiple simulations  

This is useful for algorithm visualization and academic demonstrations.
